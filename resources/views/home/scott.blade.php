            <p>Scott Hummel was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Michigan.  He attended Michigan State University.  Originally, his major was computer science.  But he discovered he was more interested in writing and graduated with a journalism degree.  He took a job as a journalist in upstate New York and learned that as much as he loved writing, he didnâ€™t enjoy reporting.</p>

            <p>He moved to New York City in 1989 and worked his way into the world of graphic design as a second career.  He spent several years writing and designing business presentations for a computer systems integration company before moving to Arizona, where his family was relocating.  The internet had become his new passion and he wanted to combine his graphic design skills and writing skills with the internet.  So he enrolled at the Art Institute of Phoenix in the web design and interactive media program.</p>

            <p>While in school between 2007 and 2010, Scott gained experience by working gratis for non-profit organizations.  This helped him to put together a body of professional work that was awarded Best Portfolio at the Spring 2010 Art Institute portfolio show.  Scott showed true acumen for web design and development while in school, garnering a 3.9 grade-point average.  This accomplishment earned his a spot in the Alpha Beta Kappa honor society.</p>

            <p>Scott graduated with highest honors in 2010 and was immediately recruited by Universal Laser Systems. In 2013, he departed Universal for Spear Education, where he currently works.  He also continues to maintain clients on the side.</p>
